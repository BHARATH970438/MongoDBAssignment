    "1. Document-Oriented : It means it stores data in flexible,semi-structured documents called BSON(Binary JSON).Which helps to store complex data structures.\n",
    "2. Sclability : It is designed to scale horizontally across mutiple severs or machines,making it highly scalable.It supports auto sharding,which enables effient handling of large datasets and high-volume workloads.\n",
    "3. High Performane : It offers high-performance data operations due to its memory-mapped storage engine and support for indexing. It utilizes in-memory processing and provides fast reads and writes, making it suitable for real-time applications and demanding workloads. \n",
    "4. Flexible DataModel : MongoDB allows for flexible data modeling, as it does not enforce a rigid schema. Each document can have its own structure, and fields can vary across documents within a collection. This flexibility enables agile development and accommodates evolving data requirements.\n",
    "5. Indexing and Replication: MongoDB supports various indexing techniques, including primary, secondary, geospatial, and text indexes. Indexes help improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. Additionally, MongoDB provides built-in replication features, allowing for automatic synchronization of data across multiple replica sets for increased availability. \n",
    "6. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: MongoDB has a vibrant and active community, providing extensive resources, documentation, and support. It offers official drivers and libraries for multiple programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate MongoDB into their applications."
